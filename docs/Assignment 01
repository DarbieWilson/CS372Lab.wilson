Timing the Towers of Hanoi:

For 5 pegs:
Recursively, the elapsed time was 7.8438e-05s.
Iteratively, the elapsed time was 1.661e-06s. 

For 10 pegs:
Recursively, the elapsed time was 3.5071e-05s.
Iteratively, the elapsed time was 2.5523e-05s. 

For 15 pegs:
Recursively, the elapsed time was 1.5623e-05s.
Iteratively, the elapsed time was 2.154e-05s. 

For 20 pegs:
Recursively, the elapsed time was 0.000117406s.
Iteratively, the elapsed time was 3.1525e-05s. 

For 20 pegs:
Recursively, the elapsed time was 0.000570223s.
Iteratively, the elapsed time was 1.638e-06s. 

For 30 pegs:
Recursively, the elapsed time was 0.0137739s.
Iteratively, the elapsed time was 1.664e-06s. 

For 35 pegs:
Recursively, the elapsed time was 0.0592224s.
Iteratively, the elapsed time was 1.0365e-05s. 

Do you see any difference in the timing between the recursive and iterative versions of the algorithm?
Yes. The iterative elapsed time was always faster than the recursive timing. 
The "gap" of time between the recusive and iterative values expanded when we increased disc counts.
